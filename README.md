# Qmedia
My work on Qmedia apk showcasing multimedia usecases such as camera, display, mediacodec and OpenGLES. This acts as a reference application and demonstrates the capabilities of Qualcomm's IoT platform.

Checkout the  iot-concam-apk.lnx.1.1.r2-rel  branch.

You can compile the android app via AOSP or you can create an Android Studio project and copy paste the code.
